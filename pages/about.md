## Etymology

Anchemy was derived from the word `al路che路my` with the first two letters of my name replacing the first two letters of the word. 

According to Oxford, `al路che路my` means: 
> "The medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed
> transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with
> attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a
> universal elixir."

It is in my hopes that I could transmute the turmoil from the chaos I've been wading in for the past two decades of my life; that somehow I could turn the muck into moldavite, and that the metamorphosis isn't just pointless strife but a part of a greater becoming.

The whole point of this is to recognize the magic in the journey. It is to remind myself that things turn golden with time, effort, and energy - not just with a single touch as Midas has led me to believe. Transcendence is in the toiling.

## Intent

Claiming this name means adhering to the call, as well as making systems and observations. These systems and observations are strategically placed in an ecosystem of static sites that would help me do the following:

* Achieve my goals;
* Reflect on my achievements, learnings, and failures; and
* Access and create personal projects.

The ecosystem is currently a work in progress and is an ever-growing living system of documents.
