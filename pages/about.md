## Etymology

Anchemy was derived from the word `al路che路my` with the first two letters of my name replacing the first two letters of the word. 

According to Oxford, `al路che路my` means: 
> "The medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed
> transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with
> attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a
> universal elixir."

It is not in my hopes to find a universal elixir, but I do aim to learn through the metamorphic events in my life and in the intrinsic transformations that take place afterwards.

## Intent

Claiming this name means adhering to the call, as well as making systems and observations. These systems and observations are strategically placed in an ecosystem of static sites that would help me do the following:

* Achieve my goals;
* Reflect on my achievements, learnings, and failures; and
* Access and create personal projects.
